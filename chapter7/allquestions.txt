17. Is there another command besides cd to change directories ?

3. When listing all shell options, which character represents the noclobber option ?
4. Deactivate the noclobber option.

7. Write a line that receives a text file, and outputs all words on a separate line.
8. Write a spell checker on the command line. (There may be a dictionary in /usr/share/
dict/ .)
. Explain the difference between these two commands. This question is very important. If
you don't know the answer, then look back at the shell chapter.
find /data -name "*.txt"
find /data -name *.txt
2. Explain the difference between these two statements. Will they both work when there are
200 .odf files in /data ? How about when there are 2 million .odf files ?

6. Here are two commands that do the same thing: copy *.odf files to /backup/ . What would

question.
cp -r /data/*.odf /backup/
find /data -name "*.odf" -exec cp {} /backup/ \;

1. Start the vimtutor and do some or all of the exercises. You might need to run aptitude

2. What 3 key sequence in command mode will duplicate the current line.
3. What 3 key sequence in command mode will switch two lines' place (line five becomes
line six and line six becomes line five).
4. What 2 key sequence in command mode will switch a character's place with the next one.
5. vi can understand macro's. A macro can be recorded with q followed by the name of
the macro. So qa will record the macro named a. Pressing q again will end the recording.
You can recall the macro with @ followed by the name of the macro. Try this example: i 1
'Escape Key' qa yyp 'Ctrl a' q 5@a (Ctrl a will increase the number with one).
6. Copy /etc/passwd to your ~/passwd. Open the last one in vi and press Ctrl v. Use the arrow
keys to select a Visual Block, you can copy this with y or delete it with d. Try pasting it.
